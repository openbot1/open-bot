/**
 * Barge-in v2 (v1.02, Team T5 — realtime voice v2).
 *
 * v0.95/v0.98 barge-in is binary: any speech while the model speaks
 * cancels the response immediately. In a real call that misfires:
 * the model's own first syllables, a cough, or a half-second "uh-huh"
 * cut a reply the user wanted to hear, and the cut-off reply is
 * lost — the transcript pretends the model never started it. This
 * controller sits in front of the cancel and decides, per speech
 * event:
 *
 *   - Grace window: speech inside the first `graceMs` of a model
 *     reply is ignored — the model just started, the user is almost
 *     certainly reacting to the *previous* turn, not interrupting
 *     this one.
 *   - Debounce: speech shorter than `minSpeechMs` is a blip (cough,
 *     mic bump), not an interruption.
 *   - Partial turns: when a reply IS cut, the text spoken so far is
 *     kept as a `partial` model turn (via `takePartialTurn()`), so
 *     the long session still knows what the user heard.
 *   - Resume policy: after an interrupt the caller chooses
 *     `resume` (the model continues the cut reply on the next turn)
 *     or `restart` (the reply is dropped and the user starts over).
 *     The policy is recorded on the decision so the UI can show it.
 *
 * Timing still goes through the v0.98 `TurnTakingMeter` (detect →
 * cancel → flush → listening, 500 ms budget) — this module decides
 * *whether* to interrupt, the meter measures *how fast* it went.
 * The controller is pure logic with an injectable clock: no socket,
 * no audio, no TTS. The session calls `noteSpeech()` and acts on
 * the returned decision.
